## Overview
This project analyzes a bank's loan performance using SQL for data validation and Tableau for visualization. The aim is to gain insights into loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, and trends, enabling better decision-making and strategy refinement.

## Software Used

The following software tools were utilized in this project:

- **Microsoft SQL Server**: For running queries to validate and analyze the dataset.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Microsoft PowerPoint**: For documenting and presenting the dataset and dashboards.


## Problem Statement
We aim to create a report to evaluate the bank's lending activities, track loan performance, and identify trends to improve strategies. Key objectives include:
- Monitoring loan application volumes and trends.
- Assessing funded and repaid amounts.
- Evaluating average interest rates and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios.
- Differentiating between good loans (fully paid or current) and bad loans (charged off).

## Dashboards

### Dashboard 1: Summary
Focuses on essential KPIs, including:
- **Total Loan Applications** (Monthly and MoM comparison)
- **Total Funded Amount** (Monthly and MoM comparison)
- **Total Amount Received** (Monthly and MoM comparison)
- **Average Interest Rate** and **Average DTI Ratio**
- **Good Loan KPIs** and **Bad Loan KPIs**
- **Loan Status Grid View** to display detailed loan status metrics.

### Dashboard 2: Overview
Provides visual insights through:
- **Monthly Trends (Line Chart):** Highlights seasonal patterns in loan metrics.
- **Regional Analysis (Map):** Lending data by state.
- **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):** Loan distribution by term length.
- **Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):** Job history impact on loans.
- **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):** Categories like debt consolidation, refinancing.
- **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):** Loans grouped by borrowersâ€™ home ownership.

### Dashboard 3: Details
A comprehensive, user-friendly dashboard offering detailed loan performance data to facilitate quick and informed decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains critical loan metrics. Here is the [Dataset](https://github.com/Dhanushbhai1054/Bank-Loan-Analysis/blob/main/financial_loan.csv).  
A PowerPoint presentation is included to explain each column for users unfamiliar with the terminology: [Dataset Presentation](https://github.com/Dhanushbhai1054/Bank-Loan-Analysis/blob/main/Data%20Set%20%20Presentation.pptx).

## SQL Queries
The SQL file includes all the queries used to validate and verify the Tableau dashboard results: [SQL Queries](https://github.com/Dhanushbhai1054/Bank-Loan-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20QUERIES.sql).  
A PDF file detailing the SQL queries is also included: [SQL Queries PDF](https://github.com/Dhanushbhai1054/Bank-Loan-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20QUERIES%20BANK%20LOAN%20REPORT.pdf).
